Up till now, I think I have learned a decent amount of stuff related to java, python, android , data analysis, a little about IOT,cloud computing, google assistant, animations, designing, gamedev , interactive content, Advertsisements and some web dev.

Native ads are the future. Native ads are.. todo ................. How IMA works with a video player? # First we should talk about videos and video view in android . We know that in Android, a VideoView is a component that plays video. how it plays videos? well there are 4 types of video rendering, as i see them : Static Offline Video Rendering : There is a video on user's device,the player simply opens an input stream and starts rendering bitstream on a view Static Online Video Rendering : there is a video present on some server, the player downloads data in small chunks, stores them in cache, play them accordingly and then clears cache. It includes many type of fetching and caching techniques and these techniques are applied to offline static video rendering too, for better results.(Although none of those optimisation settings are provided by the VideoView in default) Dynamic Offline Video Rendering(or video recording) : video is being rendered as soon as input is received from a camera sensor. This would not be technically called a video \"rendering\", because it is not controllable to start/pause/forward/reverse the playback. we just press the button to start recording the rendered bits, i.e at the press of a button, the rendered bits will also start getting saved to a file. Dynamic online video rendering(or video streaming) : A camera app or software is present somewhere in a user's mobile that is uploading image bits at runtime to some server, which passes it as response to millions of user devices in a fraction of second, and which these device render immediately . Most video streamer apps provide a rewind option like youtube, but some do not, like instagram. There are a lot of components involved in there too : infact, the whole \"renderer\" called Media Player is a different thing which sends bitmaps to a view called surface view . other things are buffers and buffer sizes, adaptive downloading, network loss handling, cache cleaning,etc. i will cover these ina seperate article on video_view and exoplayer respectively. Back to ads # So where were we? yeah, video ads .video Ads are rendered in a unique mechanism : the most famous video ad sdk is the ima sdk , which will work alongside your video player to play ads like those you see on youtube: startroll ads: small ads that plays before the content plays midroll ads : small ads that play in between the content playback endroll ads : small ads that play at the end of content playback. ad-list : group of small ads in which consequtive ads starts as soon as the previous ad ended. can be start/mid/endroll skippable/non skippable ads : long ads, but with/without a skip button, can be startroll/midroll/enndroll/ad-list. The playing of an ad on paper looks simple : there is an advideo/ list of advideos, simply when the video reaches a particular time, pause the video, start playing ads & then resume the video. But here is when the real stuff begins: Question 1 # how can a video player be able to change its playing stream in between? suppose it was previously playing a video for 60 seconds and then you wanna show an ad. How can you change its bitstream that is already loading(as i explained in the point about video players above)? Solution # So that's either not possible or i couldn't find it, but what i found a solution to this was that Ads are actually displayed over a video_view, not inside it . yes!, the parent view of your video player view will becomea kind of video player itself and the surface would use to play ad videos, while your content video remains hidden and paused into background Question 2 # <some question i had but forgot> Solution # <some answer i might but forgot> Question 3 # How will streaming of ad work? Will we be loading ads just like we load content video? Solution. # Well, yes, and no. let's look at some ad based terms: VAST(Video Ad Serving Template) TAG is standard response from any server with an ad video. Sending a req to this vast based server will send you an xml response with url to the advideo. And your video player can then simply start showing ads immediately or at a particular time instance of your choice(that is ofcourse if you have a client side code for creating and rendering an ad above current player and fortunely most of it is done by ima sdk, you just need to implement their partially visible code for that) VMAP (Video Multiple Ad Playlist) : are list of vast ads but with even more information like at whatt time each vast ad/ vast ad-group will run. A VMAP based server will also return an xml having urls of vast tag along with timestamps about which url to load ad from and at what time. This is also handled by ima sdk and its extensions and we just need to integrate it VPAID ads are based on a small lie of mine: a VAST ad does not always necessarily contain video urls but sometimes a js function called vpaid is also present. in web dev, this function is suppose to run directly on the clients machine and shows ads but it does not seem to work in mobile version of the ima sdk. So let me come to the topic that should be a little above current content: what are adevrtisements? what is google ads? why google has so many ad services ? what is the category of people that interact with what part of each service? what is IMA? what part from the company that wants to show ads to a particular app to the company that actually makes those ads to the rendering handling components to the aapps/websites that will be showing ads to the users wathing and clicking ads to the trackers to everyone , who benefit from this. So here , IMA sdk for android fails in mysterious ways: \"ima sdk exoplayer-extension for android\" fails because it is very limited and black boxed. It only works with vmap, handles all the stuff on its own and not even sends any callbacks.(As per my knowledge) \"ima sdk (library) for android\" is a little flexible, allowing both vast tags and handling of vmap but it still won't allow vpaid ads. these vpaid ads are officially not supported for android sdk, but supported for html 5 sdk. plus we loose all those optimisation features of exoplayer if that's acceptable.","title":"The World of mobile ads (Part1)"},{"location":"tab_blogs/android/mobile_ads_1/#the-world-of-mobile-ads-part1","text":"Disclaimer: The below article is very crude and mostly a collection of ideas and intutions.

There are a lot of components involved in there too : infact, the whole \"renderer\" called Media Player is a different thing which sends bitmaps to a view called surface view . other things are buffers and buffer sizes, adaptive downloading, network loss handling, cache cleaning,etc. i will cover these ina seperate article on video_view and exoplayer respectively.","title":"How IMA works with a video player?"},{"location":"tab_blogs/android/mobile_ads_1/#back-to-ads","text":"So where were we? yeah, video ads .video Ads are rendered in a unique mechanism : the most famous video ad sdk is the ima sdk , which will work alongside your video player to play ads like those you see on youtube: startroll ads: small ads that plays before the content plays midroll ads : small ads that play in between the content playback endroll ads : small ads that play at the end of content playback. ad-list : group of small ads in which consequtive ads starts as soon as the previous ad ended. can be start/mid/endroll skippable/non skippable ads : long ads, but with/without a skip button, can be startroll/midroll/enndroll/ad-list. The playing of an ad on paper looks simple : there is an advideo/ list of advideos, simply when the video reaches a particular time, pause the video, start playing ads & then resume the video. But here is when the real stuff begins:","title":"Back to ads"},{"location":"tab_blogs/android/mobile_ads_1/#question-1","text":"how can a video player be able to change its playing stream in between? suppose it was previously playing a video for 60 seconds and then you wanna show an ad.

Will we be loading ads just like we load content video?","title":"Question 3"},{"location":"tab_blogs/android/mobile_ads_1/#solution_2","text":"Well, yes, and no. let's look at some ad based terms: VAST(Video Ad Serving Template) TAG is standard response from any server with an ad video. Sending a req to this vast based server will send you an xml response with url to the advideo. And your video player can then simply start showing ads immediately or at a particular time instance of your choice(that is ofcourse if you have a client side code for creating and rendering an ad above current player and fortunely most of it is done by ima sdk, you just need to implement their partially visible code for that) VMAP (Video Multiple Ad Playlist) : are list of vast ads but with even more information like at whatt time each vast ad/ vast ad-group will run. A VMAP based server will also return an xml having urls of vast tag along with timestamps about which url to load ad from and at what time. This is also handled by ima sdk and its extensions and we just need to integrate it VPAID ads are based on a small lie of mine: a VAST ad does not always necessarily contain video urls but sometimes a js function called vpaid is also present. in web dev, this function is suppose to run directly on the clients machine and shows ads but it does not seem to work in mobile version of the ima sdk. So let me come to the topic that should be a little above current content: what are adevrtisements? what is google ads? why google has so many ad services ? what is the category of people that interact with what part of each service? what is IMA? what part from the company that wants to show ads to a particular app to the company that actually makes those ads to the rendering handling components to the aapps/websites that will be showing ads to the users wathing and clicking ads to the trackers to everyone , who benefit from this. So here , IMA sdk for android fails in mysterious ways: \"ima sdk exoplayer-extension for android\" fails because it is very limited and black boxed. It only works with vmap, handles all the stuff on its own and not even sends any callbacks.(As per my knowledge) \"ima sdk (library) for android\" is a little flexible, allowing both vast tags and handling of vmap but it still won't allow vpaid ads. these vpaid ads are officially not supported for android sdk, but supported for html 5 sdk. plus we loose all those optimisation features of exoplayer if that's acceptable.","title":"Solution."},{"location":"tab_blogs/android/world_of_videos/","text":"Exoplayer # 17/9/19 A good video player library for implementing A decent video player in your app, coz the other option of video_view from the default android sdk is less useful Steps to implement # Add Exoplayer library : Which is actually a group of 6-7 individual libraries having a jillion files. implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:2.10.4' adding this would add fucking 800 classes of this massive library.

Also java 8 support is compulsory for this library. the Bare Minimmums. # The smallest code that we need to protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { ...

In More Details, but with a tiny off topic context: Suppose I am the creator of baby shark video song. I have made this large 48 mb sized HD, bluray video and uploaded it to my fast, responsive,hypothetical aws server. I want the an app which is able to fetch this video into user's mobile without downloading it on their mobiles. This is what I call static streaming . The video player is supposed to download some small chunks(Say, 2-12 second of a video at a time) of video one by one, at real time and show it to the users on the spot. But The biggest problem with streaming is connectivity. Their are mobile users with super fast internet speeds, users with fluctuating speeds and users with terribly ugly internet speeds. Even though a 6 sec HD video would be just 700-800 KB data, it might take 4-5 seconds for a user with poor connection. So exo player has this TrackSelector class, that is responsible for choosing which file chunks to download based on perceived bandwidth changes. So, for eg, if a high quality chunk would take too long to download, the TrackSelector will choose something of lower quality to show the user. And since each chunk is usually about 2 to 12 seconds long, it\u2019s not bad if the user gets a lower quality chunk of media once in while for the benefit of a smooth experience. It Uses BandwidthMeter class to get user's current bandwidth speeds and a bunch of other classes nd factories to create different tracks of video stream chuncks or packets of different sizes and qualities. (Later we will expand more on this: what are tracks, how tracks are created, track selection and creators, How it interacts with absPlayerInstance etc ) So, to summarise, TrackSelector basically makes a setting in our exoplayer environment to download either high quality HD packets(i.e a complete packet) or low quality 144p or 360p packets(or optimised/compressed/low quality version of a packet) from a stream usually on the basis of user's Internet Connection Bandwidth and/or other factors Using this track selector we can create an almost ready to run ExoPlayer instance. Let's look into SimpleExoPlayer . At the core of the ExoPlayer library is the Player interface. This is the most powerful interface as it has definations for functions like: isPlayingAd() : weather the player is playing an ad or not. getCurrentAdGroupIndex() : index of current ad group(if ad is being played) getCurrentAdIndexInAdGroup() : index of current ad in current ad group(if ad is being played) getContentDuration() : returns either the total duration of contents(+ the ads) or C.TIME_UNSET (a constant indicating remaining time is unknown) getContentPosition() : position of content from where it will be resumed playing after ads are finished. (if ads aren't playing, will simply return same as getPosition() ) - getContentBufferedPosition() : returns an estimate of the content position in the current content window up to which data is buffered, in milliseconds.(if ads aren't playing, will simply return same as getBufferedPosition() ) get/setVolume() getAudioComponent(),getVideoComponent(),MetaDataComponent() // not exactly what you are thinking add/remove audio/videoListener addEventListener(),addErrorListener setPlayWhenRead()/ setRepeatMode()/ seekTo()/ stop()/reset()/ isLoading()/release() getCurrentTrackGroups/getTrackSelections()/geTCurrentManifest() setPlayBackParams() //like speed/pith Instances can be created through ExoPlayerFactory class. SimpleExoPlayer instance is a class which implements Player functions. ExoPlayer exposes traditional high-level media player functionality such as getAudioFormat, getCurrentPositon, getDuration, setVolume, seekTo, setPlayWhenReady, stop and much more. Just like I have mentioned before ExoPlayer uses many components to achieve its modularity and customizability. It delegates work to components which have to be injected when we create and prepare an ExoPlayer instance. The next part is specifying a MediaSource . We have assumed that their will be a video on some server that will be continuously sending us data some large chunks of data packages and our track selector and other libs will download small chuncks of it based on user bandwidth. But there is something missing, something incomplete. How is this continuous stream coming?Where is it coming from? why is it coming automatically and continuously?When and how did it started coming? How is it forever running?Why isn't data getting wasted if packet downloading speed is so fast while streaming speed is slow?Can I listen to the packets being received/decoded/...(whatever are the stages before player starts to render it and user sees it)...? These are good questions that will be obviously answered. But let's first work on our assumptions. 1. Our first assumption is very correct: There IS some server that has our video loaded in it. So our first task would be to inform our app's video handling environment, i.e the exoplayer about it A {@link Factory} that produces {@link DefaultDataSource} instances that delegate to * {@link DefaultHttpDataSource}s for non-file/asset/content URIs. Your choice of MediaSource is going to depend on the type of media you're trying to play. In this example, we're going to be playing an MP4, so we're going to use an ProgressiveMediaSource which supports formats like MP4, MP3, Matroska, and so on. If you wanted to play Dash or HLS or smooth streaming streams, then you would use the corresponding MediaSources for those different formats. Extras # Why exoplayer does not support progress listener: https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2090 logically it's the client that knows the points at which it wants a position update What if the client just wants to listen to the video current position updates? Constantly checking getCurrentPosition (e.g. with the help of Timer().scheduleAtFixedRate) is a very inefficient solution. IMHO, it would be great if ExoPlayer had a specialized method for this, somethings like setCurrentPositionListener which the developers could use to get notified about the video position changes. Since the player manages its own getCurrentPosition property it already knows when to emit onPositionChanged events. The client can only use the polling technique for this. /** // TrackSelector class * The component of an {@link ExoPlayer} responsible for selecting tracks to be consumed by each of * the player's {@link Renderer}s. The {@link DefaultTrackSelector} implementation should be * suitable for most use cases. * * <h3>Interactions with the player</h3> * * The following interactions occur between the player and its track selector during playback. * * <p> * * <ul> * <li>When the player is created it will initialize the track selector by calling {@link * #init(InvalidationListener, BandwidthMeter)}. * <li>When the player needs to make a track selection it will call {@link * #selectTracks(RendererCapabilities[], TrackGroupArray, MediaPeriodId, Timeline)}. This * typically occurs at the start of playback, when the player starts to buffer a new period of * the media being played, and when the track selector invalidates its previous selections. * <li>The player may perform a track selection well in advance of the selected tracks becoming * active, where active is defined to mean that the renderers are actually consuming media * corresponding to the selection that was made. For example when playing media containing * multiple periods, the track selection for a period is made when the player starts to buffer * that period. Hence if the player's buffering policy is to maintain a 30 second buffer, the * selection will occur approximately 30 seconds in advance of it becoming active. In fact the * selection may never become active, for example if the user seeks to some other period of * the media during the 30 second gap. The player indicates to the track selector when a * selection it has previously made becomes active by calling {@link * #onSelectionActivated(Object)}. * <li>If the track selector wishes to indicate to the player that selections it has previously * made are invalid, it can do so by calling {@link * InvalidationListener#onTrackSelectionsInvalidated()} on the {@link InvalidationListener} * that was passed to {@link #init(InvalidationListener, BandwidthMeter)}. A track selector * may wish to do this if its configuration has changed, for example if it now wishes to * prefer audio tracks in a particular language. This will trigger the player to make new * track selections. Note that the player will have to re-buffer in the case that the new * track selection for the currently playing period differs from the one that was invalidated. * </ul> * * <h3>Renderer configuration</h3> * * The {@link TrackSelectorResult} returned by {@link #selectTracks(RendererCapabilities[], * TrackGroupArray, MediaPeriodId, Timeline)} contains not only {@link TrackSelection}s for each * renderer, but also {@link RendererConfiguration}s defining configuration parameters that the * renderers should apply when consuming the corresponding media. Whilst it may seem counter- * intuitive for a track selector to also specify renderer configuration information, in practice * the two are tightly bound together. It may only be possible to play a certain combination tracks * if the renderers are configured in a particular way. Equally, it may only be possible to * configure renderers in a particular way if certain tracks are selected. Hence it makes sense to * determined the track selection and corresponding renderer configurations in a single step. * * <h3>Threading model</h3> * * All calls made by the player into the track selector are on the player's internal playback * thread.

Architecture. # If you ask me How a mobile works, then the most crude defination will simply be \"Power is connected to hardware, firmwares and switches. when pressed a hardware button, the battery starts giving power to firmware having a software bootloader. The bootloader loads the software and then the software controls everything\" ( That's pretty much defination of every OS based device system ). So, aside from a little stuff about hardware, bootloader, firmware and circuits, the Software is pretty much the main thing. And that's what Android is: the OS for mobiles. To know more about How this single thing , \"Android OS\" is able to handle everything so gracefully, We have to first learn about its architecture. A simple analogy will be that of a human: \"How Newton is able to think about gravity?\". Well, his heart pumbed blood to his brain and eyes, his eyes saw apple falling,his nerves send that stimulus to brain, his brain proceeded ...\"and that's how he thought of gravity\" . Even though this is not the right answer, it is technically correct: this was the actual procedure on how any human would think. Te correct answer would be \"He was a skilled man with a great ackquired knowledge, he got tinto a correct interesting environment and automatically got an idea\" . This is so much like an app! You are not required to understand a deep architecture of OS to make an app, infact you could just have a comfortable environment setup completely by android studio, build everything by modules , generators and libraries and you just pressing the build button. But of you do, you might make a better more optimised app. So let\u2019s start with this only, What is an architecture? (Note: This entire article(after the tldr) below is copied from deepam goel's amazing article , which i cannot explain any better. ) So any software or system is based on some set of components that work together to accomplish some certain task or to perform some specific function. This is a vast topic and without discussing much about it lets see what components Android is made up of and how they all work together to make things happen. What are Android OS Components? Android OS is based on the stack of 5 main components, viz: 1. System Applications 2. Application Framework 3. Libraries 4. Android Runtime 5. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) 6. Linux Kernel Application # ( more info ) These are the application that we all make and use. They reside on the topmost layer of Android Architecture. Application Framework # ( more info ) The Application Framework layer provides many higher-level services to applications in the form of Java classes and also contains other APIs. Application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications. Libraries # ( more info ) Above Linux kernel, there is a set of libraries including open-source Web browser engine WebKit, well-known library libc, SQLite database, libraries to play and record audio and video, SSL libraries responsible for Internet security etc. All Java based libraries that are needed for building Android app also resides here. Android Runtime # ( more info ) This portion contains one of the most important components Dalvik Virtual Machine, DVM. This is a kind of JVM that is specially optimized and made for Android. It enables every android app to run its own process which enables us to run many applications at same time. It basically converts .java file into .Dex format. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) # ( more info ) A HAL defines a standard interface for hardware vendors to implement, which enables Android to be agnostic about lower-level driver implementations. Using a HAL allows you to implement functionality without affecting or modifying the higher level system. HAL implementations are packaged into modules and loaded by the Android system at the appropriate time. Linux Kernel # ( more info ) Kernel is core of any OS. The Linux Kernel sits at the bottom of Android architecture. The Android platform is built on top of the Linux 2.6 Kernel. The Linux Kernel provides support for many features like memory management, security management, process management, and device management etc. It also contains all the driver that helps Android device to communicate with other hardware devices. Note DVM was officially replaced by Android Run Time, ART in Lollipop version. It has many advantages over DVM. To know more about ART, Check this post .

Adding permissions. # We have to add the following permission to allow our app to receive and send data via a network connection: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> The second permission is to check weather the user\u2019s device is connected to a network or not. Since both permissions are safe and not dangerous, we do not need to provide a runtime check 2. Checking the connection. # Here comes the code part. We have to first check weather our system is connected to the internet a Network. For this, we use the following piece of code: private boolean isConnectedToMobileDataOrWify(){ ConnectivityManager connectivityManager = (ConnectivityManager) getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE); NetworkInfo networkInfo = connectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfo(); return networkInfo != null && networkInfo.isConnected() && (networkInfo.getType() == ConnectivityManager.TYPE_WIFI || networkInfo.getType() == ConnectivityManager.TYPE_MOBILE); } ( We would be later using A decoupled asynctask, therefore it would be eventually broken and used in a different manner.) Note that this specifically refers to a network type of Wify or Mobile. There DOES exist other types of network, specifically: Type,value type,value (psfi) TYPE_NONE = -1; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE = 0; (psfi) TYPE_WIFI = 1; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_MMS = 2; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_SUPL = 3; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_DUN = 4; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_HIPRI = 5; (psfi) TYPE_WIMAX = 6; (psfi) TYPE_BLUETOOTH = 7; (psfi) TYPE_DUMMY = 8; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_FOTA = 10; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_IMS = 11; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_CBS = 12; (psfi) TYPE_WIFI_P2P = 13; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_IA = 14; (psfi) TYPE_MOBILE_EMERGENCY = 15; (psfi) TYPE_PROXY = 16; (psfi) TYPE_VPN = 17; (psfi) TYPE_ETHERNET = 9; Update: usage of these integers is deprecated. Now, networkCapabilitiesObj.hasTransport(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_WIFI) ;Or connectivityManager.requestNetwork(networkRequestObj,networkCallbackObj) is used. 3. Making a connection(Theory) # Next we would be establishing a connection. Before we establish a connection, one thing should be pretty clear: Danger All the network fetching / uploading / other network related tasks should be performed on a separate thread. The ui operations would obviously be performed on the ui thread , therefore we use a Threadsafe Asynctask ( An Asynctask created in a headless fragment along with callbacks to prevent leaking ) which could perform a network task and safely update ui for task progress and later, task completion. There are some other concepts in regard to a network task: Http Connection : HttpURLConnection is the official Android Api for creating an http connection In android.According to geeksforgeeks, The \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol that uses TCP as an underlying transport and typically runs on port 80. HTTP is a stateless protocol i.e. server maintains no information about past client requests.\u201d This hidden link has a lot of info regarding different functions and features of HttpConnection class. Get and Post() : something about security, blah blah blah. Would look into networking someday. Not important in android development. From what I know from my app dev experience in claro, both get() and post() request is like calling a server and demanding a response. Our calling method would contain a custom query(like google.com?q=animal where \u201canimal\u201d is a search result we want). Both methods will give us a json or XML response against the query . - In get() ,the request to server itself contains queries like https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=5&order=desc&sort=activity&site=stackoverflow\" In post() , we have to pass queries alongside the request to server in a json string. This json string is hidden inside a requestBody obj. libraries like okhttp help create and pass these json string alongside request in a very simple way, like request.putString(\u201cpagesize\u201d,\u201d5\u201d) or putString(\u201cemail\u201d,\u201cansh@example.com\u201d) . in native http way, we have to perform a lot of steps for such thing , like adding it to outputstream\u2019s buffer, creating aurl encoded string, etc. This reason for this distinguishment is most probably the security issues. I guess the code behind checking the get request is either very small or none at all. But in case of post request there might be some encoding decoding algorithms involved. If you ask a web dev, they would simply say \"get me to url me hi sbkuch pass hota hai, to isse passwords leak hone ka khatra hai but post chhipa rehega to no khatra\". 4. Making a Connection (Code)(to be continued) # The above was the the set of general and commone things that are needed in making a get/post connection. Next we will be seeing the code for it. Now before heading to code, there is a thing to handle threads. Now, threads cause a lot of memory and context leaks which needs to be handled. So we will be seeing the native code for doing this(which handles problem of thread leakage using Threadsafe asynctasks enclosed in Fragments ) and then we will be seeing Libraries made for performing get/post requests which i don't know how or weather they are handling these or not.","title":"Part1, basics"},{"location":"tab_blogs/android/networking/networking_get_post_basics/#networking-basics-making-a-get-post-connectiontheory","text":"Networking would refer to the use of internet inside an app. There could be a million and 1 way to be using internet in an app: your app could be a chat app for sending/receiving messages , reddit like social media app, instagram like pictures app, or even a feed app like google news app. During network transmissions, there are many things that need to be kept in mind : paging, caching, asynchronous loading and transmission, realtime ui updates,etc So let\u2019s start from the very basics.","title":"Networking Basics : Making a Get Post Connection(Theory)"},{"location":"tab_blogs/android/networking/networking_get_post_basics/#1-adding-permissions","text":"We have to add the following permission to allow our app to receive and send data via a network connection: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> The second permission is to check weather the user\u2019s device is connected to a network or not.

From what I know from my app dev experience in claro, both get() and post() request is like calling a server and demanding a response. Our calling method would contain a custom query(like google.com?q=animal where \u201canimal\u201d is a search result we want). Both methods will give us a json or XML response against the query . - In get() ,the request to server itself contains queries like https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=5&order=desc&sort=activity&site=stackoverflow\" In post() , we have to pass queries alongside the request to server in a json string. This json string is hidden inside a requestBody obj. libraries like okhttp help create and pass these json string alongside request in a very simple way, like request.putString(\u201cpagesize\u201d,\u201d5\u201d) or putString(\u201cemail\u201d,\u201cansh@example.com\u201d) . in native http way, we have to perform a lot of steps for such thing , like adding it to outputstream\u2019s buffer, creating aurl encoded string, etc. This reason for this distinguishment is most probably the security issues. I guess the code behind checking the get request is either very small or none at all. But in case of post request there might be some encoding decoding algorithms involved. If you ask a web dev, they would simply say \"get me to url me hi sbkuch pass hota hai, to isse passwords leak hone ka khatra hai but post chhipa rehega to no khatra\".","title":"3.

Multiple concurrent network connections. Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence. Support for request prioritization. Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel. Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff. Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network. Debugging and tracing tools.

Multiple concurrent network connections. Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence. Support for request prioritization. Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel. Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff. Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.

Admonition # Admonition is an extension included in the standard Markdown library that makes it possible to add block-styled side content to your documentation, for example summaries, notes, hints or warnings. Installation # Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - admonition Usage # Admonition blocks follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title # By default, the block title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can easily be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title # Similar to setting a custom title , the icon and title can be omitted by providing an empty string after the type qualifier: Example: !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded code blocks # Blocks can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks \u2013 except code blocks, because the parser from the standard Markdown library does not account for those. However, the PyMdown Extensions package adds an extension called SuperFences , which makes it possible to nest code blocks within other blocks, respectively Admonition blocks. Example: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.Name, Employees.Salary, Manager.Name AS Manager FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Employees AS Manager ON Employees.ManagerID = Manager.EmployeeID WHERE Employees.EmployeeID = '087652'; Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Collapsible blocks # The Details extension which is also part of the PyMdown Extensions package adds support for rendering collapsible Admonition blocks. This is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature. Example: ??? note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. By adding a + sign directly after the start marker, blocks can be rendered open by default. Types # Admonition supports user-defined type qualifiers which may influence the style of the inserted block. Following is a list of type qualifiers provided by the Material theme, whereas the default type, and thus fallback for unknown type qualifiers, is note . Note # Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
