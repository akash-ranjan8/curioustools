#Welcome!

Here you would find somethings that i wanna write about.  

Since the day I came into College(and maybe even before that, but then it was school and 
I was more focussed towards the non tech subjects), I have been trying to learn something 
new in tech world everyday. I am a fan of everything techy : be it be new smartphones, 
new games,  new webseries on Startups or Tech or just a new technology.  

Up till now, I think I have learned a decent amount of stuff related to java, python, 
android , data analysis, a little about IOT,cloud computing, google assistant, animations, 
designing, gamedev , interactive content, Advertsisements and some web dev. I even earned 
a few bucks in internships from these.

But let me tell you, 99% of my knowledge comes from this blessed internet.Youtube videos, 
Github, StackOverflow(its a God site, i tell you) , forums, medium, developer docs... you 
name it. I am eternally grateful to this  worldwide connection of 
anonymous and non-anonymous people who makes technology and resources available to every
human.  

So, my aim of creating this site was to open source everything that I have learned so far.
It would be beneficial in 2 ways : 1)this would create a digital record of my learnings so
I won't worry if i forget about them and 2) you might find this content useful.  
Note that This may contain content from proprietary sources and i don't take credits for any such work.
