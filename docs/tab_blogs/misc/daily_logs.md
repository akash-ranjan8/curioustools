### 24/9/19  
SATURDAY! After an ass busting week of papers, i am happy to relax for sometime. 
I didn't applied for leave for today at my office, they are gonna cut the salary, damn :/
Also, fuck i didn't recieved pass for the devfest delhi :'( .  
Anyways today i am continuing my work with exoplayer from the last week, but before that ,

i am in a mood for learning something new : like making this site. i am torn between using
mkdocs, jekyll wordpress or simply html/css .  

- mkdocs is cool, but i still need to run 4 commands and update yaml everytime i add a 
page. It also has a lot of theme limitations and require knowledge of html/css to fix 
them.

- jekyll is also ok, but does not come with a defualy theme, You will have to create 
your own theme in order to make it look nice. but it too had support for external themes.
But again, it had some stuff which needed to be updated manually.

- wordpress is something i am curious about. i heard it is somewhat paid, but a parts of 
  it are free too . it is seen as a very advance version with all those tags and dynamic 
  content support, but also needs html/css/js knowledge for advance customizations

- I don't wanna use html/css because i hate them(Damn, my biggest weakness: why i hate the
most popular type of development in this industry, the web dev? Ugh, i don't know. so much
shit goin on, so many tags, so much sophistication in small stuffs... i had to learn theses
stuff, else i would lag behind... aagh fuck)  

Anyhoo, currently going with this mkdocs theme . did some refactoring in yml file, and 
about to add some general articles.
